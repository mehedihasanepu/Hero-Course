## Question 1 (Assignment project features)

- **Course Listings**:
The website offers a variety of courses for visitors to browse.
Each course listing includes essential information such as the course name, credit hours, course price, and course details.

- **Cart**:
Visitors have the ability to select multiple courses and add them to their shopping cart. But visitors can't add the same course multiple times.
When a course is added to the cart, it should display the following information:

- **Cart information**
  - *Course name:* The name of the course the visitor selected
  - *Total price:*Â The total cost of all the courses in the cart
  - *Total credit hours:* The total credit hours of all the courses in the cart
  - *Limited Credit Hours:* Visitors are allocated a specific number of credit hours.As visitors add courses to their cart, the system calculates and shows the remaining hours.Before allowing a course to be added to the cart, the website checks if the visitor has enough remaining credit hours. If the visitor has enough remaining credit hours, then the course can be added to the cart. If the visitor's credit hours are insufficient, the system shows a toast message.
